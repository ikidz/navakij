Significant accounting policies\u000d\u000a4.1 Product classification\u000d\u000aThe Company classified insurance and reinsurance contracts based on the nature of the insurance \u000d\u000acontract. Insurance contracts are those contracts where the insurer has accepted significant insurance risk \u000d\u000afrom another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain \u000d\u000afuture event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder. To determine whether a significant \u000d\u000ainsurance risk has been accepted, the insurer compares the benefits payable after an insured event with \u000d\u000athe benefits payable if the insured event did not occur. If the criteria are not met, the Company classifies \u000d\u000athe insurance contract as an investment contract. Investment contracts have the legal form of insurance \u000d\u000acontracts and transfer financial risk to the insurer, but not significant insurance risk. Financial risks are \u000d\u000aspecified as interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, or price risk. \u000d\u000aThe Company classifies contracts based on assessment of the significance of the insurance risk at \u000d\u000ainception of contract, on a contract by - contract basis. Once a contract has been classified as an \u000d\u000ainsurance contract, it remains an insurance contract for the remainder of its lifetime. A contract classified \u000d\u000aas an investment contract at inception can be reclassified as an insurance contract after inception if the \u000d\u000ainsurance risk becomes significant.\u000d\u000aThe Company classifies all insurance contracts as short-term insurance contracts, which means insurance \u000d\u000acontracts that have coverage periods of up to 1 year and no automatic renewal clause, as well as \u000d\u000ainsurance contracts that have coverage periods of more than 1 year and the Company can terminate, \u000d\u000aincrease or decrease insurance premiums or change any benefits of the insurance contracts throughout \u000d\u000athe coverage period.\u000d\u000a4.2 Revenue recognition\u000d\u000a(a) Gross premium written\u000d\u000aGross premium written consists of direct premium and reinsurance premium less premium of \u000d\u000acanceled policies and premiums refunded to policyholders.\u000d\u000aDirect premium is recognised as income on the date the insurance policy comes into effect at the \u000d\u000aamount specify in the policies.\u000d\u000aReinsurance premium is recognised as income on the date the insurance policy comes into effect, \u000d\u000aor when the reinsurer places the statement of accounts with the Company.\u000d\u000a(b) Fee and commission income\u000d\u000aFee and commission income from ceded premium are recognised as income when incurred. \u000d\u000a156","56-1 One Report 2022\u000d\u000a4\u000d\u000aWe, being responsible for the preparation of\u000d\u000athese financial statements and notes thereto,\u000d\u000ahereby approve their issue in final form.\u000d\u000a\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026.\u000d\u000aDirectors\u000d\u000a(c) Interest income and dividends received from investments\u000d\u000aInterest income\u000d\u000aInterest income is calculated using the effective interest method and recognised on an accrual \u000d\u000abasis.

assumption\u000d\u000aThe methodology and assumptions adopted for the gross and net valuations of insurance contract \u000d\u000aliabilities (claim reserves and outstanding claims) as at31 December 2022 and 2021are presented as \u000d\u000afollows:\u000d\u000a(a) Outstanding claims provision\u000d\u000a1. Direct and inward facultative business \u000d\u000aThe Company used 3 actuarial methods as follows: \u000d\u000a1.1 Chain Ladder method based on both claims paid and claims incurred\u000d\u000a1.2 Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (\u201cBF\u201d) based on both claims paid and claims incurred\u000d\u000a1.3 Expected Loss Ratio method (\u201cELR\u201d)\u000d\u000aThe Company mostly relies on the Chain Ladder method on claims incurred to derive the best \u000d\u000aestimate of claims liability. The BF and ELR methods are also used where appropriate. Loss \u000d\u000aDevelopment Factors (\u201cLDF\u201d) are selected based on a range of criteria, which include the\u000d\u000apattern of historical claims payments and claims incurred. In most instances, the loss \u000d\u000adevelopment factors selected are based on various average loss development factors for each \u000d\u000adevelopment year. The Company also takes into consideration whether averages may not be \u000d\u000aappropriate, for reasons such as the average not reflecting the Company\u2019s operational changes, \u000d\u000athe average being inappropriate due to distortion by large claims, or the average being contrary \u000d\u000ato a trend of the historical ratios. \u000d\u000aBoth qualitative and quantitative factors are taken by the Company into consideration in the \u000d\u000aselection of LDF to produce claim reserves that appropriately reflect the Company\u2019s future \u000d\u000aclaims liability as at the valuation date.\u000d\u000a2. Inward treaty business \u000d\u000aThe Company uses a basic approach in estimating claims reserves provision for inward treaty \u000d\u000abusiness. This approach assumes that the claims reserves requirements for the inward treaty \u000d\u000abusiness would be proportionally similar to those of the direct and inward facultative business. \u000d\u000aThe Company therefore use the percentage of gross outstanding case reserves to apply with \u000d\u000ainward treaty contracts.\u000d\u000a(b) Estimation of Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses reserve(ULAE)\u000d\u000aIn determining the ULAE, the Company used total expenses to estimate the claim expenses. ULAE is \u000d\u000acalculated from the ratio of ULAE to the average of paid loss and reported loss which is based on \u000d\u000athe assumption that half of a claim\u2019s ULAE is expended when a loss is reported, and half when it is \u000d\u000apaid.\u000d\u000a192","56-1 One Report 202240\u000d\u000aWe, being responsible for the preparation of\u000d\u000athese financial statements and notes thereto,\u000d\u000ahereby approve their issue in final form.\u000d\u000a\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026.\u000d\u000aDirectors\u000d\u000aThe ULAE ratios are computed for motor and non-motor classes separately and are applied onto the \u000d\u000abest estimate of gross claim liability (excluding flood claims in 2011) to obtain the ULAE reserves for \u000d\u000aclaims liability.\u000d\u000aULAE reserve is computed as the sum of the ULAE ratio multiplied by half of the case reserve and \u000d\u000aoutstanding claims, plus the ULAE ratio multiplied by the incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserve.\u000d\u000a(c) Economic assumptions \u000d\u000aThe Company has not discounted for future investment earnings, and has not explicitly inflation \u000d\u000aadjusted claim amounts payable in the future. However, the Company has implicitly allowed for \u000d\u000afuture claims inflation to the extent that this is evident in past claims development. \u000d\u000a(d) Other assumptions \u000d\u000aThe Company has assumed that claims development patterns are generally consistent and stable \u000d\u000aover the years and also assumed that the past inflation pattern will continue into future projected \u000d\u000ayears. For claims prior to accident year 2004, the Company has reached their ultimate claim so \u000d\u000athere would be no IBNR from these claims.\u000d\u000a18.4 Unearned premium reserves\u000d\u000a(Unit: Baht)\u000d\u000aFor the years ended 31 December\u000d\u000a2022 2021\u000d\u000aBeginning balance 1,818,326,935 1,778,705,006\u000d\u000aPremium written for the year 3,666,681,691 3,372,953,128\u000d\u000aPremium earned for the current year (3,455,342,282) (3,333,331,199)\u000d\u000aEnding balance 2,029,666,344 1,818,326,935\u000d\u000a19.
